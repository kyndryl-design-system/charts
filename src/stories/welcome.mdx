# Shidoka Charts

A data visualization library of framework-agnostic web components built with Chart.js.

## Getting Started

View the [Readme here](https://github.com/kyndryl-design-system/shidoka-charts).

## Chart.js

These charts are driven by [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) and wrapped as a Web Component. Default configurations are included so each chart has the Shidoka look and feel out of the box. Charts can still be fully customized using the Chart.js API, and additional plugins can also be added. Please see the [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) for more fine-grained control and [examples](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/information.html) beyond what you see here.
